                                    I'm interested in learning how to code to help broaded my understanding of how data is stored. I'm a molecular biologist and spend a lot of time trying to figure out how things work on a basic level. I'm learning that I acquire a ton of data and have never really had any direction on how to organize it. I've worked at a few biotech companies that seem to range in supportive organizational help from very structured to...not. A recent exposure to hiring a consultant to develop a LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) and converting/migrating all the raw data to a database forced me to learn some jargon (booleans, string, logics) on a very, very basic level to communicate what the scientists want versus the design team. It was a challenge that left me realizing how little I know (having never taken a computer science course), and an encouragement in seeing how much my thought process might align with that universe if I learned it.

                                    <br>
                                    I'm excited to be thrown into the deep end with this bootcamp because other, self-taught methods of learning how to code through Python and SQL books haven't been quite effective in keeping my attention. This is a challenge and I'm excited to finangle my way through it!

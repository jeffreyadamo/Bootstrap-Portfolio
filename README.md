Adamo Bootstrap Portfolio Homework 2

## Things I had trouble with
* I think I overcomplicated the navbar. Was never able to get it to stretch to the right side of the page when extended.
* The navbar hamburger appears when collapsed, is not functional.
* I feel behind in the @media component. I briefly tried it out, but moved on when it didn't work and seemed futile. I tried not to let it bog me down.
* The Bootstrap classes seem to be stubborn sometimes, especially the .container.
* The text around the image on index.html was able to get inline wrapping around the image but I would like to have whole blocks of text collapse together rather than one word at a time. It makes the title look squeezed at thinner widths. I imagine this can be fixed with the @media designation or parsing the text into separate tags
* I think I used too much CSS instead of understanding the Bootstrap components. Later when I started figuring out the Bootstrap components, it was difficult to figure out what overwriting CSS classes controlled what.
* It took me way to long to figure out the background image was one folder set up from the relative folder.
* This felt daunting and hopeless at first, but I was able to chip away at it pretty well.
